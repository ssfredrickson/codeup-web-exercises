          The National Park Service was created by an act signed by President
          Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916. Yellowstone National Park was
          established by an act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1,
          1872, as the nation's first national park.

        What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?
      </dt>
      <dd class="invisible colorText">
        <p>
          The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service
          emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on July 20, 1951. The
          components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes
          of the National Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison
          representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water
          representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself
          representing historical and archeological values.

          The system includes 424 areas covering more than 85 million acres in
          every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto
          Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These areas include national parks,
          monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic
          sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and
          trails, and the White House.

      <dd class="invisible colorText">
        <p>
          Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You
          can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges
          an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we
          recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to
          locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes
          available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer
          entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to
          the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and
          Volunteer passes).
